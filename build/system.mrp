Slice Logic Distribution:
  Number of LUT Flip Flop pairs used:        1,981
    Number with an unused Flip Flop:           867 out of   1,981   43%
    Number with an unused LUT:                 621 out of   1,981   31%
    Number of fully used LUT-FF pairs:         493 out of   1,981   24%
    Number of unique control sets:              39
    Number of slice register sites lost
      to control set restrictions:              63 out of 126,800    1%

  A LUT Flip Flop pair for this architecture represents one LUT paired with
  one Flip Flop within a slice.  A control set is a unique combination of
  clock, reset, set, and enable signals for a registered element.
  The Slice Logic Distribution report is not meaningful if the design is
  over-mapped for a non-slice resource or if Placement fails.
  OVERMAPPING of BRAM resources should be ignored if the design is
  over-mapped for a non-BRAM resource or if placement fails.
